//! Single, deduplicated identity enum for all settings.
//!
//! This replaces the two parallel `Kind` enums that previously existed in
//! `setting_row` and `setting_value`.  It is only used to route
//! [`SettingsEvent::UpdateValue`](crate::view::settings_editor::SettingsEvent)
//! events to the correct view — the view layer itself contains no per-setting
//! match arms.

/// Identifies a specific setting value view for targeted updates.
///
/// Used in [`SettingsEvent::UpdateValue`](crate::view::settings_editor::SettingsEvent)
/// so that [`CategoryEditor`](crate::view::settings_editor::CategoryEditor) can tell
/// exactly which [`SettingValue`](crate::view::settings_editor::SettingValue) to
/// refresh after a setting changes.
