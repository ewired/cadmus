//! Trait and supporting types for defining individual settings.
//!
//! Each setting is a small struct that implements [`SettingKind`]. The trait
//! encapsulates everything a [`SettingRow`](crate::view::settings_editor::SettingRow)
//! needs to know: the row label, the current display value, which widget to
//! render (`ActionLabel`, `Toggle`, or `SubMenu`), and which event to fire on tap.
//!
//! [`SettingIdentity`] is the single, deduplicated identity enum used by
//! [`SettingsEvent::UpdateValue`](crate::view::settings_editor::SettingsEvent) to
//! target the correct [`SettingValue`](crate::view::settings_editor::SettingValue) view.
