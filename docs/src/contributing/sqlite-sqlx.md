# SQLite & SQLx

Cadmus uses [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) as its embedded database and
[SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) as the Rust database library.
SQLx provides **compile-time SQL verification** — every query is checked against
the real schema before the code ships.

## The `.sqlx` directory

The `.sqlx/` directory at the repository root contains one JSON metadata file
per SQL query. Each file stores the resolved column names, types, and parameter
types that SQLx inferred from the live database schema at the time
`cargo sqlx prepare` was last run.

```text
.sqlx/
├── query-10c2db2a….json   ← compile-time metadata for one query
├── query-13c26d81….json
└── …
```

### Regenerating query metadata

After adding or changing any SQL query, regenerate the metadata:

```bash
cargo sqlx prepare --all --workspace
```

This connects to the database, re-introspects every query macro in the
workspace, and rewrites the `.sqlx/` JSON files. Commit the updated files
alongside your code change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you forget to run `cargo sqlx prepare`, the CI `check` job will fail
> because the cached metadata will be out of date with your query changes.

## Compile-time SQL checking

SQLx's typed query macros (`query!`, `query_as!`, `query_scalar!`) verify SQL at
compile time using the metadata in `.sqlx/`. This means:

- Typos in column names are **compiler errors**, not runtime panics.
- Binding the wrong type to a `?` placeholder is a **type error**.
- Adding or removing a column in a migration without updating queries is caught
  **before deployment**.

The macros require the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point at a live
database when running `cargo sqlx prepare`, but **not** during regular `cargo
build` or `cargo check` — those use the pre-generated `.sqlx/` files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `.sqlx/` is only used when the `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` field is set which is
> the default if you're using devenv.nix.

## Review rules

The following rules are enforced during code review for all SQLx queries.

### Use typed macros only

Always use the typed macros. Never call the untyped `query()`, `query_as()`, or
`query_scalar()` functions:

| Goal                                       | Use                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, raw `SELECT` | `sqlx::query!`        |
| `SELECT` mapped into a named struct        | `sqlx::query_as!`     |
| Single-column `SELECT`                     | `sqlx::query_scalar!` |

When the column is nullable, call `.flatten()` on the result to collapse
`Option<Option<T>>` into `Option<T>`:

```rust
let id: Option<i64> =
    sqlx::query_scalar!("SELECT id FROM libraries WHERE path = ?", path)
        .fetch_optional(pool)
        .await?
        .flatten();
```

### List explicit column names

Never use `SELECT *`. Always name every column you need:

```sql
-- ✅ Good
SELECT id, path, name FROM libraries WHERE id = ?

-- ❌ Bad
SELECT * FROM libraries WHERE id = ?
```

### Store timestamps as Unix epoch integers

All date/time values must be stored as `INTEGER NOT NULL` (Unix epoch seconds).
Do not use `TEXT` columns for timestamps:

```sql
-- ✅ Good
created_at INTEGER NOT NULL

-- ❌ Bad
created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
```

### Add only indexes that are actively used

Every index must be used by at least one query in the codebase. Unused indexes
waste write performance and storage without any read benefit. Before adding an
index, verify a query filters, sorts, or joins on the indexed column(s).

## API reference

The primary database types live in the `cadmus_core::db` module:

- <a href="/api/cadmus_core/db/struct.Database">`cadmus_core::db::Database`</a> —
  the top-level sync/async bridge that owns the connection pool
- <a href="/api/cadmus_core/db/migrations/struct.MigrationRunner">`cadmus_core::db::migrations::MigrationRunner`</a> —
  executes all pending runtime migrations
- <a href="/api/cadmus_core/macro.migration">`cadmus_core::migration!`</a> —
  macro for declaring one-time runtime migrations

See [Library Database](library-database.md) for how the library subsystem uses
the database, and [Runtime Migrations](runtime-migrations.md) for how to write
one-time data migrations.
