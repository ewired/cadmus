# OTA updates

Once Cadmus is installed, you can update it wirelessly without connecting to a
computer. The OTA (Over-The-Air) feature downloads updates directly from GitHub.

## What you need

- A WiFi connection

Stable releases are public and require no authentication. Main branch and PR
builds require a GitHub account — Cadmus will guide you through a one-time
sign-in the first time you request one.

## How to update

Open **Main Menu → Check for Updates**. You'll see options for where to get the
update from:

| Source             | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Stable Release** | Latest official release from GitHub            |
| **Main Branch**    | Latest development build (most recent changes) |
| **PR Build**       | Test a specific pull request                   |

> [!NOTE]
> The _Stable Release_ option is not shown in test builds.

## Updating from the main branch

Select **Main Branch** to get the most recent development build. This includes
changes that have been merged but not yet released officially.

If this is your first time, Cadmus will show a screen with a URL and a short
code. On any device with a browser:

1. Go to the URL shown on screen
2. Enter the code shown on your Device
3. Sign in to GitHub and approve the request

Cadmus will detect the approval automatically and start the download. The token
is saved to disk so you won't need to sign in again.

The update downloads from GitHub, installs automatically, and reboots the device
to finish.

## Testing a pull request

Select **PR Build** to try out a specific change before it's released. Enter the
PR number when prompted. The same one-time GitHub sign-in applies if you haven't
authenticated before.

> [!TIP]
> Find the PR number in the GitHub URL. For example, in
> `github.com/OGKevin/cadmus/pull/42` the PR number is **42**.

## Normal vs test builds

OTA works for both types of builds. The type you're currently using determines
what gets downloaded:

- **Normal builds** update to `KoboRoot.tgz` in `/mnt/onboard/.adds/cadmus`
- **Test builds** update to `KoboRoot-test.tgz` in `/mnt/onboard/.adds/cadmus-tst`

See the [available packages](./index.md#available-packages) table for all
options.

## First-time setup

OTA only works for updating an existing installation. To install Cadmus for the
first time, follow the [installation guide](./index.md) or the
[test builds guide](./test-builds.md) to copy a KoboRoot file via USB.
