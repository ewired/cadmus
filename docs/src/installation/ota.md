# OTA updates

Once Cadmus is installed, you can update it wirelessly without connecting to a
computer. The OTA (Over-The-Air) feature downloads updates directly from GitHub.

## What you need

- A WiFi connection

## Authentication

Main branch and PR builds require a GitHub account. Stable releases are public
and need no authentication.

The first time you request a main branch or PR build, Cadmus will show a screen
with a URL and a short code:

1. Go to the URL shown on screen
2. Enter the code shown on your device
3. Sign in to GitHub and approve the request

Cadmus detects the approval automatically and starts the download. The token is
saved to disk so you won't need to sign in again.

## How to update

Open **Main Menu → Check for Updates**. You'll see options for where to get the
update from:

| Source             | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Stable Release** | Latest official release from GitHub            |
| **Main Branch**    | Latest development build (most recent changes) |
| **PR Build**       | Test a specific pull request                   |

> [!NOTE]
> The _Stable Release_ option is not shown in test builds.

## Updating from the main branch

Select **Main Branch** to get the most recent development build. This includes
changes that have been merged but not yet released officially.

If you haven't authenticated before, Cadmus will guide you through the GitHub
sign-in process. See [Authentication](#authentication) for details.

The update downloads from GitHub, installs automatically, and reboots the device
to finish.

Before that reboot, Cadmus removes the files it previously installed so the new
package can replace them cleanly. Your custom fonts, icons, and other
user-added files will be preserved.

## Testing a pull request

Select **PR Build** to try out a specific change before it's released. Enter the
PR number when prompted. If you haven't authenticated before, Cadmus will guide
you through the GitHub sign-in process. See [Authentication](#authentication)
for details.

> [!TIP]
> Find the PR number in the GitHub URL. For example, in
> `github.com/OGKevin/cadmus/pull/42` the PR number is **42**.

## Normal vs test builds

OTA works for both types of builds. The type you're currently using determines
what gets downloaded:

- **Normal builds** update to `KoboRoot.tgz` in `/mnt/onboard/.adds/cadmus`
- **Test builds** update to `KoboRoot-test.tgz` in `/mnt/onboard/.adds/cadmus-tst`

See the [available packages](./index.md#available-packages) table for all
options.

## First-time setup

OTA only works for updating an existing installation. To install Cadmus for the
first time, follow the [installation guide](./index.md) or the
[test builds guide](./test-builds.md) to copy a KoboRoot file via USB.

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient disk space" error

If Cadmus shows an error like _"Insufficient disk space: need 100MB, have XMB"_
while downloading an update:

- Cadmus downloads update files into a `tmp` folder:
  - **With SD card**: `/mnt/sd/.cadmus/tmp` (uses SD card space)
  - **Without SD card**: `/mnt/onboard/.adds/cadmus/tmp` (uses internal storage)
- If you see this error and have an SD card inserted, the card may be full
- If you do not have an SD card, free up space on internal storage by deleting
  books or other files you do not need
